# Misstortion

Distortion plugin for VST-based hosts. Does its best to be like Logic's Clip Distortion, which makes it very useful for the hardstyle genre.

Download prebuilt binaries [on the Itch.io page](https://nimble.itch.io/misstortion).

* **Hard clip**: Simple hard clip distortion.
* **Soft clip**: Hyperbolic soft clip distortion.
* **Symmetry**: Make your waveform asymmetrical for more finetuned distortion.

It's free! It runs on Windows DAW's, both 32 bit and 64 bit, so there's no need to bridge them by hand. A version for Mac will come later.
